# The Problem We Solve

## The Agricultural Financing Gap

Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet **farmers face a critical challenge**: access to working capital.

## The Farmer's Dilemma

```
📋 Contract Signed          ❌ No Capital          🚫 Can't Execute
   (Payment in 90 days)  →     (For operations)  →    (Lost opportunity)
```

### Real-World Scenario

A farmer secures a contract with a major buyer (offtaker) like a food manufacturer:

| What They Have               | What They Need                       | The Gap                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Guaranteed purchase contract | $10,000 for seeds, fertilizer, labor | Banks won't lend              |
| Invoice payable in 90 days   | Capital TODAY                        | No collateral accepted        |
| Proven track record          | Quick, affordable financing          | Traditional loans take months |

### Why Traditional Solutions Fail

| Solution             | Problem                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Banks**            | Complex paperwork, long approval times, collateral requirements |
| **Microfinance**     | Interest rates of 20-50% annually                               |
| **Loan Sharks**      | Predatory rates, coercive collection practices                  |
| **Personal Savings** | Limits farm scale and growth                                    |

## The Investor's Challenge

On the other side, **retail investors** face their own barriers:

### Investment Complexity

| Challenge                        | Impact                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **DeFi is intimidating**         | Wallets, gas fees, slippage—too technical    |
| **RWA platforms are opaque**     | Hard to verify what you're investing in      |
| **Minimum investments are high** | Traditional invoice financing requires $50K+ |
| **No engagement**                | Lock money and forget—boring experience      |

---

## The Trust Deficit

Both parties suffer from a **lack of trust and transparency**:

- **Investors** can't verify if the invoice is real
- **Farmers** can't prove their credibility easily
- **Intermediaries** take large fees for connecting them
- **No visibility** into how funds are used
