| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Has contract worth $10,000 | Payment due in 90 days                  |
| Needs capital now          | For seeds, fertilizer, labor            |
| Banks require collateral   | Smallholders lack acceptable collateral |

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| DeFi complexity | Wallets, gas, slippage are intimidating      |
| RWA opacity     | Hard to verify underlying assets             |

## The Trust Deficit

Both parties face verification problems:

- Investors cannot easily verify invoice authenticity
- Farmers cannot prove creditworthiness without traditional credit history
- Intermediaries extract large fees
- No visibility into fund utilization
