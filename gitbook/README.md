> **Bridging Farmers to Capital Through Gamified Invoice Financing**

---

## Welcome to OwnaFarm 🌾

OwnaFarm is a **blockchain-powered platform** that transforms agricultural invoice financing into an engaging, game-like investment experience. We connect farmers who need working capital with investors who seek transparent, real-world asset (RWA) backed yields.

Built on **Mantle Network L2**, OwnaFarm tokenizes farmer invoices and presents them as "virtual seeds" that investors can purchase, nurture, and harvest for returns—just like a farming simulation game.

## The Big Picture

```
👨‍🌾 Farmer has contract invoice → 🌱 Invoice becomes "Seed" NFT → 💰 Investors fund it
                                                                          ↓
        📈 Farmer gets working capital ← 🌾 Invoice matures → 💵 Investors harvest profits
```

## User Story

### Meet Pak Budi – The Farmer

Pak Budi is a chili farmer in Central Java. He just signed a **contract with Indofood** to supply 10 tons of chili in 90 days. The contract guarantees payment upon delivery—but here's the problem:

**He needs Rp 50 million NOW** for seeds, fertilizer, and labor. Banks won't lend to smallholder farmers. Loan sharks charge 30%+ interest.

### Meet Lisa – The Investor

Lisa is a professional in Jakarta. She wants to invest in something **real and impactful**, not speculative crypto. She has savings but limited time to analyze complex financial instruments.

### How OwnaFarm Connects Them

1. **Pak Budi** registers his Indofood invoice on OwnaFarm
2. The invoice becomes a "**Chili Seed**" in our game marketplace
3. **Lisa** opens the app, sees "Indofood Chili – 15% Yield – 90 Days"
4. She buys the seed with GOLD tokens (stablecoin)
5. For 90 days, she can water her virtual plant, earn XP, and watch it grow
6. When the real invoice matures, she **harvests** her principal + 15% yield
7. **Pak Budi** received his Rp 50 million on Day 1 to run his farm

**Everyone wins.**
