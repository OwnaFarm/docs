## The Concept

| Traditional Finance | OwnaFarm         |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Invoice document    | Virtual seed     |
| Investment          | Plant in garden  |
| Wait for maturity   | Watch plant grow |
| Receive returns     | Harvest crops    |

Investors interact with a game-like interface while funding real agricultural invoices. The complexity of invoice financing is abstracted into familiar farming game mechanics.
